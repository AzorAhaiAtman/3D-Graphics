1. In line 9 of the rend.cpp file 
     --select WIREFRAME as 1 to get a wireframe model of the teapot. 
     --select WIREFRAME as 0 to get the rasterized teapot

2. Added a Render -> RotateAnimation button that rotates the teapot along the y-axis. The resulting animation is stored in sequentially generated ppm files.
-- For this purpose modifications to the following files were made

---- CS580HW.rc
---- CS580HWView.h
---- CS580HWView.cpp
---- Application3.cpp

Can Rotate the rendered teapot as well as the wireframe.
